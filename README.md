# Data-Analysis-of-College-Score-Card

This is the final project of my CDS 101 class. The question of research is "Is there an earnings gap between male and female college graduates 6 years after graduation, and does the gap widen or shrink 4 years later"?

Visualization and hypothesis testing were employed to study this question.
